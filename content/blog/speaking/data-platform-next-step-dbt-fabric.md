I gave a talk at the [Data Platform Next Step](https://dataplatformnextstep.com/breakout-sessions/) conference in Billund, Denmark. The conference was the first conference with sessions about [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric) right after the launch of the public preview at [Microsoft Build](https://build.microsoft.com/).

dbt is the new data transformation tool taking the world by storm. It lowers the barrier of entry into the world of data analytics to everyone who ever wrote a line of SQL. Did you know it integrates quite well with all Microsoft SQL products and even with Fabric? Join this session to follow in the footsteps of thousands of analytics engineers and fall in love with dbt. Learn more about how dbt works with Fabric and Azure SQL from the maintainer of the official dbt adapter! Weâ€™ll use Fabric and VS Code to build our first Hello Fabric project.
