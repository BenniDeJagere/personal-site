On September 26th, 2019, I organized the [RMDY](https://rmdy.be/) Tech Dive in Edegem. This was a public event with several topics about web, cloud & mobile app development.

During this meetup, I did a talk about serverless on Azure. I explained what serverless is, what Azure Functions are and how you can use them to build your own serverless applications.
