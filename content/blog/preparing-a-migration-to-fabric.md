If all those posts about Microsoft Fabric have made you curious, you might want to consider it as your next data platform. Since it is very new, not all features are available yet and most are still in preview. You could already adopt it, but if you want to deploy this to a production scenario, you'll want to wait a bit longer. In the meantime, you can already start preparing for the migration. In this post, I will give you some tips on how to prepare for a migration to Microsoft Fabric.

If you are still considering your options for your next data platform, I listed the migration paths below in order from easiest to hardest.

## Lakehouse-based data platforms

### Migration from Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pools

This is **by far the easiest** migration path. If you don't have anything yet today, I'd recommend to consider Synapse Serverless as your in-between platform.

### Migration from Databricks SQL Warehouses

## Spark-based data platforms

### Migration from Azure Synapse Spark Pools

### Migration from Databricks Spark Pools

## SQL-based data platforms

### Migration from Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools

### Migration from Azure SQL Database

### Migration from Google BigQuery or AWS Athena

## Other data platforms

### Migration from Azure HDInsight, Trino, Presto, Hive, ...
