Sam Debruyn is currently working as a data engineer / consultant. His interests lie in data engineering and cloud native technologies.

## Data Engineering?

Data Engineering has been around for a while, but the term itself is still relatively new. A lot of people were actually doing data engineering without them even realising it! I personally see a data engineer as the person who deploys data platforms and data science solutions and actually puts them in production. A data engineer builds data pipelines, data lakes, data warehouses and works with various data sources and sinks.

## Talk tech to me

These are the technologies I work most with.

* Programming languages: Python, SQL, Scala, Go, HCL...
* Cloud: ❤️ Azure
* Tools: dbt, Databricks/Spark, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes...

This is not my resume, I've worked with other technologies in the past and I'm always eager to play with new technologies.

## I thought you were a mobile app developer?

In 2016 I began my career as a cross-platform mobile app developer using [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). In 2017 I became a technical lead and team lead. I've always had an interest in big data and as a technical lead I helped customers with their solution architecture, including cloud components. This sparked my interest and both interests come together in my current job as a data engineer.

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
