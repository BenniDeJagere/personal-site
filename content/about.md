## Data Engineering?

Data Engineering has been around for a while, but the term itself is still relatively new. A lot of people were actually doing data engineering without them even realising it! I personally see a data engineer as the person who deploys data science solutions and actually puts them in production. A data engineer builds data pipelines, data lakes and works with various data sources and sinks. [This excellent blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/who-is-a-data-engineer-how-to-become-a-data-engineer-1167ddc12811) explains this in further detail.

## Talk tech to me

These are the technologies I work most with.

* Programming languages: Python, Scala, Go, SQL, HCL
* Clouds: Azure, GCP, AWS
* Tools: Databricks/Spark, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes

This is not my resume, I've worked with other technologies in the past and I'm always eager to play with new technologies.

## I thought you were a mobile app developer?

In 2016 I began my career as a cross-platform mobile app developer using [Xamarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xamarin) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev). In 2017 I became a technical lead and team lead. I've always had an interest in big data and as a technical lead I helped customers with their solution architecture, including cloud components. This picked my interest and both interests come together in my current job as a data engineer.

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
