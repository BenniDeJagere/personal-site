Sam Debruyn is currently working as a Technical Lead Data & Cloud. His interests lie in data engineering and cloud native technologies.

## Data Engineering?

Data Engineering has been around for a while, but the term itself is still relatively new. A lot of people were actually doing data engineering without them even realising it! I personally see a data engineer as the person who deploys data platforms and data science solutions and actually puts them in production. A data engineer builds data pipelines, data lakes, data warehouses and works with various data sources and sinks.

## Talk tech to me

These are the technologies I work most with.

* Programming languages: Python, SQL, Go, HCL, Scala...
* Cloud: ❤️ Azure
* Tools: dbt, Databricks/Spark, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes...

This is not my resume, I've worked with other technologies in the past and I'm always eager to play with new technologies.

> Computer programming is an art,
because it applies accumulated knowledge to the world,
because it requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because it produces objects of beauty.
A programmer who subconsciously views himself as an artist
will enjoy what he does and will do it better.
