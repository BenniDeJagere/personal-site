> Here I hosted this demonstration/interview during a lunch webinar at [dataroots](https://dataroots.io).

In this rootlabs session we will be joined by Paul-Armand Verhaegen and Joeri Rammelaere from Mediahuis. They will guide us through their setup of the data platform at Mediahuis.

The team chose Dask as the key component in their data platform to facilitate data scientists more easily. It will be interesting to hear them talk about the advantages which Dask offers compared to the more common setups using Apache Spark.
