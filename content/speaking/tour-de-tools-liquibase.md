In this session, Sam Debruyn (aka Official Liquibase Fanboy, soon to be Legend) will demonstrate Liquibase -- an open source database schema version controller . After an introduction on schema versioning and presentation of Liquibase, Sam will narrate us some stories from the trenches: how to optimally use the tool locally to avoid writing cumbersome XML, testing your transformations and integration with your automation tool.
